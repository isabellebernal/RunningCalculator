# RunningCalculator
This calculator will provide runners with splits calculations
I have added a file that shows my documentation when coding the running split calculator in both Java and Javascript.
I have added the file with the Java code for the running split calculator to show the process I went through with the math portion of this calculator.
I have added the HTML file that includes my Javascript code along with the CSS and HTML code that I did to design my calculator.
