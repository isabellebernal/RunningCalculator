# RunningCalculator
This calculator will provide runners with Splits and V02max calculations
I have added a file that shows my documentation when coding the running split calculator in both Java and Javascript.
I have added the file with the Java code for my running split calculator to show the process I went through with the math portion of this calculator.
I have added the HTML file that includes my Javascript code along with the CSS and HTML code that I did to design my calculator.
I collaborated with a partner and my partner did the vo2max calculator portion of the running calculator but only the early design portion for the vo2max calculator is in the file. Other than that design the rest of the file is the splits calculator and everything I contributed.
