# RunningCalculator
This calculator will provide runners with running split calculations
I have added a file that shows my documentation when coding the running split calculator in both Java and Javascript.
I have added a second file with the Java code for the running split calculator to show the process I went through with the math portion of this calculator.
I have added a third file that includes the Javascript code along with the CSS and HTML code that I did to design my calculator.
